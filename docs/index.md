# Sentech API Documentation

Welcome to the Sentech API Documentation. Below are the available endpoints:

- [Create a Memory Field](create-memory-field.md)
- [Add a Memory](add-memory.md)
- [Query Memories](query-memories.md)
- [Chat Completions](chat-completions.md)
- [Get Supported Models](supported-models.md)

## Authentication

All API endpoints require authentication via an API key. Pass the API key in the `Authorization` header as follows:

```sh
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

## Memory Fields

Memory Fields serve as containers for storing AI-generated knowledge, or knowledge in general.. Each field is designed to hold related pieces of information that can be retrieved, updated, and connected dynamically over time. Memories in a field are ranked by **salience**, **relevance**, and **decay rate**, ensuring the most significant information is easily accessible while less relevant data naturally fades over time.

### Technical Details
- **Salience**: Measures the importance of a memory within the field.
- **Relevance**: Determines how well a memory matches queries.
- **Decay Rate**: Applies gradual relevance decay to older memories.
- **Connections**: Establish relationships between memories for more meaningful recall.

## Roadmap

We are actively developing new features to enhance the API, including:

- **Fine-Tuning Salience & Relevance**: Endpoints to adjust memory importance manually.
- **Dynamic Memory Clustering**: Automated reclustering of memories within fields.
- **Custom Relationship Management**: Fine-grained control over memory connections.

## Rate Limiting

To ensure fair usage, the API enforces rate limits based on subscription tiers:

| Tier/Plan    | Memory Field Queries per Month | Memories Added per Month |
|---------|------------------|-------------------|
| Free    | 1,000            | 500               |
| Basic   | 10,000           | 5,000             |
| Standard| 10,000           | 5,000             |
| Premium | 50,000           | 50,000            |

If you exceed your plan's limit, consider upgrading your subscription.
